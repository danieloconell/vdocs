# Vdocs
An online text editor with Vim key bindings.

### Why? ###

* Because I love Vim efficiency
* Because I want to edit documents online.
* Put two together  :heart:.

### How do I get set up? ###

* This is intended to be run from a server (specifically Heroku).
* You will need to install the requirements.
* Do this with `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`.
* This is done by `python3 app.py`.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* I doubt anyone will contribute because this is a private repo.
